#10cloud task

#Start

`npm install`

To run headless tests: `npm run cy:r` 

To open cypress gui: `npm run cy:o`


## Summary
Use cypress + js to resolve task.

Add whole configuration include eslint and prettier.

Showed one of possible approaches to the topic. Used piece of page object model and add some custom method to cy.

Additionally used components folder as navigation shows up on every page and form selectors 
are the same for both contact and adoption forms.

Moreover add utils function for create user data.

Application got some bugs I took some viable routes to automate. 

Next step would be adding CI/CD integration and visual tests and of course more coverage for cypress tests.
